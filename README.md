VR Nanodegree Course 1 Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nishant Greene first First Project Game
I changed the three buttons to change the sun toggle, particle color, and shape change, when clicked on. Changing these overall took about 15 minutes. However, building the project from xcode to the iphone took an additional 20 minutes because it would not build because it needed to have a code sign under the project management tab. It took a while for me to figure this out but I managed to address the issue. This was a very enlightening experience in an introduction to developing VR games overall.
