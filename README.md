VR Nanodegree Course 1 Project: Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a beginner's VR project that was used to understand the mechanics of Unity. The assets included provided tools to practice with in a VR game, using gameObjects and UI with buttons to press. WHen you press the given buttons, various instances would occur such as raining cubes and changing the scene from day to night. The scripts were already provided in this project (ex. the VR camera) as the purpose was to work with the features that the scripts provided and how it relates to VR overall.
